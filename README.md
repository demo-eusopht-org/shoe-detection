## Introduction

This project is a Flask application designed to process images by detecting shoes and replacing them with a user-provided shoe image. It leverages machine learning techniques for object detection and computer vision libraries for image manipulation. The application is simple to use, providing an interactive web interface where users can upload images and preview results.

---

## Features

- **Shoe Detection**: Uses advanced object detection algorithms to identify shoes in an image.
- **Shoe Replacement**: Replaces detected shoes with a user-specified shoe image.
- **Web Interface**: Intuitive interface for image uploads and result previews.
- **Customizable**: Supports configuration of detection thresholds and output image size.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language for backend logic.
- **Flask**: The web framework for building the application.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and manipulation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (or another library, depending on implementation): For shoe detection using pre-trained models.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For creating the web interface.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shoe-detection-replacement.git
   cd shoe-detection-replacement
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Pre-Trained Model**:
   Place the pre-trained shoe detection model (e.g., `shoe_model.h5`) in the `models/` directory.

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

---

## Usage

1. Navigate to the web interface in your browser.
2. Upload an image containing shoes.
3. Upload the replacement shoe image.
4. Click "Process" to view and download the updated image.

## Configuration

- **Detection Threshold**: Adjust the model confidence threshold in `app.py`.
- **Output Image Size**: Configure the resolution of processed images in the application settings.
- **Model Path**: Ensure the model file is correctly linked in `app.py`.

## Examples

Here are some example use cases:

### Input Image
![Input Image](static/examples/input.jpg)

### Replacement Shoe
![Replacement Shoe](static/examples/replacement_shoe.jpg)

### Output Image
![Output Image](static/examples/output.jpg)

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Flask Server Not Starting**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and the virtual environment is activated.
- **Model Not Found**: Verify that the model file exists in the `models/` directory.
- **Image Processing Issues**: Check if the uploaded images meet the required format (e.g., JPEG/PNG).
